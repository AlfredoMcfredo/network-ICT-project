        <h2>LOCAL AREA NETWORKS(LANs)</h2>
        <p>
          These systems are usually within one building, or certainly not very
          far away from each other geographically. A typical LAN will consist of
          a number of computers and devices (for example, printers) that are
          connected to hubs or switches. One of the hubs or switches will
          usually be connected to a router and a modem (usually broadband) to
          allow the LAN to connect to the internet; in doing so it then becomes
          part of a WAN.
        </p>
        <p>Advantages</p>
        <ul style="padding: 25px">
          <li>
            The sharing of resources (such as expensive peripherals and
            applications software).
          </li>
          <li>Ease of communication between users.</li>
          <li>
            A network administrator to control and monitor all aspects of the
            network (for example, changing passwords, monitoring internet use
            and so on).
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Disadvantages</p>
        <ul style="padding: 25px">
          <li>Easier spread of viruses throughout the whole network.</li>
          <li>Printer queues developing, which can be frustrating.</li>
          <li>Slower access to external networks, such as the internet.</li>
          <li>
            Increased security risk when compared to stand-alone computers.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the main server breaks down, in most cases the network will no
            longer function.

        <h2>WIDE AREA NETWORKS (WANs)</h2>
        <p>
          Wide area networks (WANs) are used where computers or networks are
          situated a long distance from each other geographically (e.g. in a
          different city or country). As mentioned earlier, if a number of LANs
          are joined together using a router or modem, then they can form a WAN.
          The most common examples of WAN include the internet and the network
          of ATMs (automated teller machines) used by banks. Because of the long
          distances between devices, WANs usually make use of some public
          communications network (such as telephone lines or satellites) but
          they can use dedicated or leased communication lines which can be less
          expensive and also more secure (less risk of hacking). A typical WAN
          will consist of end systems and intermediate systems (see diagram). 1,
          3, 7 and 10 are known as end systems and the remainder are known as
          intermediate systems. The distance between each system can be
          considerable, especially if the WAN is run by a multinational company.

        <h2>WIRELESS LANs (WLANs)</h2>
        <p>
          Wireless LANs (WLANs) are similar to LANs but there are no wires or
          cables. In other words, they provide wireless network communications
          over fairly short distances (a few metres) using radio or infrared
          signals instead of cables. Devices, known as access points (APs) or
          wireless nodes, are connected to the wired network at fixed locations.
          Because of the limited range, most commercial LANs (for example, at a
          college campus or at an airport) Figure 4.5 A network connecting WLANS
          need several APs to permit uninterrupted wireless communications. The
          APs use either spread spectrum technology (which is a wideband radio
          frequency with a range of about 30-50 m) or infrared (which has a very
          about 1-2m and is easily blocked; it therefore, has a limited use).
          The AP receives and transmits data between the WLAN and the wired
          network structure. End-users access the WLAN through wireless LAN
          adapters that are built into the devices or are a plug-in module.
        </p>
        <p>Advantages</p>
        <ul style="padding: 25px">
          <li>
            All computers can access the same services and resources (such as
            printers, scanners, internet access) from anywhere within range of
            the APs.
          </li>
          <li>
            As there is no cabling there is a safety improvement and increased
            flexibility (since the user no longer has to remain at their desk).
          </li>
          <li>
            Adding new computers and devices is very easy (all that is required
            is a WLAN adapter) and the costs are reduced since extra cabling
            isn't needed.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Disadvantages</p>
        <ul style="padding: 25px">
          <li>
            Security can be a big issue since anyone with a WLAN-enabled laptop
            can access a network if it can pick up a signal; it is therefore
            necessary to adopt complex data encryption techniques.
          </li>
          <li></li>
          <li>
            There may be problems of interference, which can affect the signal.
          </li>
          <li>The data transfer rate is slower than in a wired LAN.</li>
